## Taylor Font

Hi! I am Taylor Font, and welcome to my site! I am a mechanical engineer turned
consultant/software developer/general technology geek from the United States.

I love learning up-and-coming technolgies, putting them into practice, and
contribtuing back to the open source community.

I currently spend my days split between my working hours at `$dayjob` doing all
sorts of crazy things and volunteering with the Ghostty team as a helper.
